# OctoMemo


So, currently I no longer like using note-taking apps like Ever...(You know who :elephant:), so I've been using Github to save some notes on my CS classes, internship and other stuffs. However, I don't like the idea of having to log into Github to add a simple note. Therefore, I created this CLI to accomplish this task.
